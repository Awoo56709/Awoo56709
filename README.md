I constantly strive to learn what is important to me and how I can use my interests to the benefits of others. I am an R and Python enthusiast but a professional sponge.

## Some things about me.

- I enjoy camping and outdoor drives. Love driving in my VW bus to go on camping adventures in Souther California
- I play guitar (badly) but love to get lost in music.
- I love analogue photography. I have a collection of soviet film cameras from the 50's onward and follow the ways of the Lomography
- I am a huge fan of Dystopian novels. Some day I will have a collection..
